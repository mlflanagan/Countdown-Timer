# Workout-Timer

This is a Javascript countdown timer I use for home workouts to keep count of my sets and to let me know that it's time for the next set.

It is hosted on an Apache web server running on a Raspberry Pi.

The timer beeps at the start and again when it gets below 10 seconds.

The web page itself shows 30 sec, 1 min, 1 min 30 sec, and 2 min buttons to start the timer. It also has checkboxes at the bottom to keep track of how many sets have been completed.

The html, javascript, and css also demonstrate:
- How to make circular checkboxs
- How to use javascript callbacks

The css is optimized for a Galaxy Tab A 10.1 tablet so tyou may need to adjust the appContainer width for your device.
